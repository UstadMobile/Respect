# RESPECT App Maestro tests

## Development environment setup:
* Complete development environment setup as per main [README](../README.md)
* Install [Maestro CLI](https://github.com/mobile-dev-inc/Maestro/releases).

## Run an individual test:

* Build the project as per the main [README](../README.md)
* Start respect-server and add a school as per the main project README.
* Install the APK on the Android Emulator or device being used to run tests
  e.g.
```
adb install ./respect-app-compose/build/outputs/apk/debug/respect-app-compose-debug.apk
```

* Run test using Maestro CLI (specify the school URL and admin password):
```
maestro test \
    -e SCHOOL_URL=http://192.168.1.2:8094/ \
    -e SCHOOL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=adminpassword \
    -e SCHOOL_NAME=TestSchool
    .maestro/flows/flow_name.yaml
```

Where:
* ```SCHOOL_URL``` is the URL for the school as used with the addschool command as  as per the main
  [README](../README.md)
* ```SCHOOL_ADMIN_PASSWORD``` is the password for the admin user for the school (also as per addschool command)
* ```SCHOOL_NAME``` is the name of the school (also as per addschool command)

## Run multiple tests (suite)

Running multiple tests with Maestro requires a blank server installation for each test.
[TestServerController](https://github.com/UstadMobile/TestServerController) is used to start/stop a new blank server instance on a free port as
required.

See run-maestro-ci.sh (work in progress).
