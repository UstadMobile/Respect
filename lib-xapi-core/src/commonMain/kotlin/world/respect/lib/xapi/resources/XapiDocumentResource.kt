     * an unordered collection, so the order of keys is not fixed.
     *
     * This logic will ONLY be executed in the offline repository implementation such that:
     * a) The post to the update the deletions profile id is enqueued to the RemoteWriteQueue
     * b) Duplicate requests are avoided (e.g. if this logic executed in the httpclient
     *    implementation and the database it could lead to duplicate requests etc)
     *
     * The deletions profile itself MUST NOT be deleted. When a deletion happens a POST request is
     * made to the Document Resource with the deletion. Because as per the xAPI spec JSON POST
     * requests are merged, this results in a state document listing the deleted profiles and when
     * they were deleted. This enables proper synchronization of deletions: an offline first
     * repository can determine if a profileId no longer present in the remote was actually deleted
     * (and local data should be deleted to reflect this) or local data has not yet synced to the
     * remote (and local data should not be deleted).
