/**
 * When saving credentials we can only save a 'username', we also need to know the learning space
 * url. Linking each credential strictly to a learning space origin would make it impossible to show
 * a simple dialog when the user first starts the app to select an account from any learning space.
 *
 * The credential username is used both as user.name for a passkey and the username when saving a
 * username and password to a password manager.
 *
 * The username is visible to the user so we want this to be as user-friendly as possible.
 * The credential username will be as follows:
 *
 * username@example.org where the LearningSpace uses https and the standard port
 * username@example.org:port where the LearningSpace uses https and a non-standard port
 * username@http://example.org/ where the LearningSpace does not use https
