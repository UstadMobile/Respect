/**
 * The primary representation of an Xapi Statement in the database. Note that the full original
 * json is stored on StatementEntityJson (such that results data can be retrieved without downloading
 * the full json string).
 *
 * @param statementIdHi the hi bits of the statement id (which is a UUID)
 * @param statementIdLo the lo bits of the statement id (which is a UUID)
 * @param statementActorPersonUid where the actor is a single known person, the personUid. This is
 *        will be set for self-paced content such as videos / xAPI / H5P packages completed by an
 *        individual, but might not be set otherwise. It will not be set when the actor is a group
 * @param resultDuration the duration of the result in ms (if provided), otherwise 0
 * @param extensionProgress Captures the progress extension ( as per
 *        https://aicc.github.io/CMI-5_Spec_Current/samples/scenarios/13-progress_usage/ ) for use
 *        to show progress in the UI. Integer between 0 and 100 as per progress extension.
 * @param statementActorUid the ActorEntity.actorUid for the actor referenced by the actor property
 * @param statementObjectType the object type of the statement as a flag : Activity, Agent, Group,
 * StatementRef, or SubStatement
 * @param statementObjectUid1 where the object type is an Activity, Agent, or Group the uid of the
 * respective entity. When a StatementRef, the most significant uuid bits (hi). When a SubStatement,
 * the statementId will be set to the same as statementIdHi
 * @param statementObjectUid2 where the object type is an Activity, Agent, or Group, then 0. When a
 * StatementRef, the least significant uuid bits (lo). When a substatement, then statementIdLo + 1
 * @param isSubStatement if true, this is a substatement which cannot be independently retrieved.
 * @param completionOrProgress Indicates whether or not the statement is completion or progress
 * (excludes xAPI statements that are progress or completion of child activities for statements
 * received over API) - e.g. the statement could be relevant to showing the progress of the learner.
 * @param contextStatementRefIdHi most significant bits of the context registration uuid
 * @param contextStatementRefIdLo least significant bits of the context registration uuid
 * @param contextRegistrationHash the xxhash64 of contextStatementRefIdHi and contextStatementRefIdLo
 *        for purposes of reporting queries where there is a need to count the number of distinct
 *        contextRegistrations. COUNT(DISTINCT...) cannot work with multiple columns. xxhash64 has
 *        an extremely low risk of collision, not enough to meaningfully alter statistics.

 * This is used as an index field so that the database can quickly filter out other types of
 * statements (e.g. statements that are not for the top level activity, dont have a score,
 * completion status, etc). Given that Statements are click stream level, there are a lot
 * of them, so this index is important to help speed up queries on table that will get big.
 *
 * This is true if the statement has a result with a non null value for result score scaled
