 * Represents the progress on a particular assigned activityId for one actor. This is used as a

 * The completed and successful fields will be:
 *  True if there is a matching statement with the result.field set to true
 *  False if there is no matching statement with the result.field set to true, but there is a
 *  matching statement with the result set to false.
 *  Null if there is no matching statement with the result set to true or false.
 *
 *
 * @param activityId the activityId this represents progress for
 * @param completed set as above
 * @param successful set as above
 * @param scoreScaled the highest raw score for this activityId, null if there are no matching
 *        statements with a non-null score.
 * @param progress the maximum progress extension value on any matching statement, null if there is
 *        none.
